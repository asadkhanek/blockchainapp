# Blockchain Web Application

This project is a comprehensive blockchain web application with the following features:

1. User Management (registration, authentication, profiles)
2. Blockchain core functionality (explorer, mining, transactions)
3. Cryptography and security (key management, digital signatures)
4. Wallet management (create, send/receive, history)
5. Smart Contracts (deployment, execution, monitoring)
6. Admin Panel (user management, network monitoring)
7. Notifications, Reporting, and Analytics

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js with Redux
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Blockchain: Custom implementation with Ethereum compatibility
- Authentication: JWT with 2FA support
- Cryptography: ECC, RSA, AES-256, SHA-256

## Project Structure Guidelines

- Use ES6+ syntax and functional components in React
- Follow RESTful API design patterns
- Document all functions and APIs with JSDoc comments
- Use proper error handling and logging
- Ensure all cryptographic operations follow security best practices
- Implement proper input validation for all user inputs
- Maintain separation of concerns between blockchain, API, and UI layers
